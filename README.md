# PolyTickets

## Concept
A Dapp built on Polygon that allows users to buy and sell tickets as NFTs for all sorts of events.

- The current ticket issuing and selling platforms have a lot of flaws from both the seller and buyer perspectives. 
- The web2 model has been failing users in many different areas and the ticketing industry is one of them.
- By adopting a web3 model, a ticketing platform would give control back to the users, whether they are sellers or buyers.

## Problems in the ticketing industry:

Event organizers get a small percentage of the profits because they rely on 3rd party sellers and due to ticket resells.
A small portion of the tickets are sold at fair prices due to criminal activity, high demand and other forms of reselling.
Scammers take advantage of buyers on the secondary market as there is no way to prove the tickets are authentic or werenâ€™t sold to many different people.
The lifespan of a ticket is usually very short as it usually serves no other purpose after attending the event and is forgotten about.

## Solution:

Event organizers gain back control over their profits as every time a ticket is selled they will get a percentage.
Human verification powered by mathematical and cryptographic proofs would ensure buyers are real humans.
NFTs (non fungible tokens) are unique and identifiable tokens. The user would easily be able to validate if a ticket is authentic. Blockchain technology also prevents tickets from being sold more than once, therefore reducing the likelihood of buyers being scammed.
Not only NFTs live forever in the blockchain as event organizers would be able to create unique perks for the ticket holders.


### App Features:

Event organizers will be able to issue tickets as a NFT collection.
- The process is as streamlined as possible and all processes are handled through an intuitive UI.
- The event organizers can add custom designs and functionalities to the tickets such as access to exclusive communities and offer discounts for other events or merchandise to ticket holders.
- The ticket has a QR code that can be scanned by the event organizers to allow the user to attend the event.
- Event organizers can define a certain percentage of the first ticket sale (mint) to custom payees and define a percentage they would get from resells.

Event organizers have access to the sales data.
- Event organizers have access to a dashboard with all the information about ticket sales in the form of graphs and spreadsheets.

Event organizers can advertise their events.
- Event organizers can create ads inside the platform to advertise their events and increase ticket sales.

Users can buy tickets.
- Users get access to a marketplace where they can search for events.
- The user can filter events according to date, price, location and event category.

Users have full control over their tickets.
- The user can view all their tickets on their user profile and or wallet.
- Users can connect a non-custodial wallet to the Dapp or use the built in wallet.
- Users can list their tickets for sale at any time.


## The Challenge:
The main challenge with this concept is to convert web2 users.

There are 2 solutions to try and diminish the friction for user adoption.
- Automatically create a wallet for the user when they sign up with credentials they might already have for other apps like an email or phone number.
- Make purchases frictionless by allowing users to buy the ticket with a Debit or Credit Card.
